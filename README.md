### ðŸ“Œ **Featured Projects**

- [**Student Loan Risk Modeling**](https://github.com/andrew-ng1/student_loan_risk_modelling)  
  Built and compared **logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Keras deep neural network models** to predict high-risk applicants; best model achieved ROC-AUC 0.95 and captured 76% of risky loans at 5% FPR, with permutation importance explainability to inform underwriting policy.

- [**HDFS Log Anomaly Detection**](https://github.com/andrew-ng1/hdfs_log_anomaly_detection_oncloud)  
  Built an end-to-end **cloud pipeline (AWS EC2/S3 + CLI) to run NLP-based deep learning (CNN)** anomaly detection on 500K+ HDFS logs, achieving 95.6% accuracy and F1 = 0.977.
  
- [**BC Surgical Wait Times Dashboard**](https://github.com/andrew-ng1/bc-surgical-wait-times-dashboard) 
  Developed and deployed an **interactive dashboard (Plotly Dash on Heroku)** analyzing 12 years of BC surgical wait-time data; **EDA** revealed backlog growth and regional disparities, providing insights to aid BC health administrators in resource planning.

- [**UBC MDS Distributed Systems Labs**](https://github.com/andrew-ng1/spark-cassandra-labs) - Utilized **Scala in Databricks** to generate synthetic customer/order datasets, applied **Spark (PySpark)** to build distributed **ETL** pipelines on this data, and implemented **Cassandra (NoSQL)** schemas for student/course data with replication and CRUD queries.
